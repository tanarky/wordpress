== Theme features ==

= Logo setting =

You can upload a logo image in Customizer.

= 6 page templates =

* Right Sidebar ( default )
* Left Sidebar
* No Sidebar
* Full Width ( Fixed )
* Full Width ( Fluid )
* For Front Page

= 5 blog layouts =

* Right Sidebar ( default )
* Left Sidebar
* No Sidebar
* Full Width ( Fixed )
* Full Width ( Fluid )

= Header paterns =

* Left logo + Right global navigation ( default )
* Top Left logo + Bottom Left global navigation
* Top Center logo + Bottom Center global navigation
* The fixed and non-fixed layout are provided for each layouts above.

= Widget areas =

* Sidebar
* Footer ( you can select number of columns )

= Navigation =

* Global navigation ( in header )
* Social navigation ( in footer )  
  If you enter URLs of social services, their icons will appear.

= HTML5, Microformats compatible =

HTML5 mark upped. Page structure follows Bootstrap and it's kept as simple as possible.

Micro formats compatible. WordPress, by default, outputs a class "hentry", which belongs to microformats and so this theme adjust everything with it.

= Front end page speed optimization =

Front end page optimization for speed is done by the theme. Compression/combining of CSS/Javascript files, and loading Javascripts on footer. Original files and SASS files are also bundled (but not loaded) in the theme, so you can use them on customizing.

= Useful CSS class =

* .section: A class for sectioning contents with margins in, for example, one page design.
* .section.section-image: A class to adjust background image for a section.
* .section.section-fixed: A fixed version of section.section-image class.
* .section .section-title: A class for section title.
* jumbotron .btn-default: A class which is provided in Bootstrap but I've customized it into Ghost style.

= Off campus navigation on mobiles =

Global menu goes off canvas on mobiles. You don't need to add another menu for mobile phones.

= Using child theme =

While you can @import or wp_enqueue_script the style.min.css from your child theme, I want to introduce you another way of creating a child theme, which you can utilize the variables and functions of Sassified Bootstrap. Set a Sass file in your child theme and @import /habakiri/src/scss/style so that you can compile them with Gulp and such.

This is a example of customizing functions.php in child theme.

`
// in functions.php
function habakiri_child_theme_setup() {
	class Habakiri extends Habakiri_Base_Functions {
		// Override constructer
		public function __construct() {
			parent::__construct();
			// Add filter
			add_filter( 'foo', array( $this, 'your_filter' ) );
		}

		// load style.css of habakiri
		// If you use bottstrap of habakiri, this method is unnecessary.
		public function wp_enqueue_scripts() {
			wp_enqueue_style(
				get_template(),
				get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.min.css',
				null
			);
			parent::wp_enqueue_scripts();
		}

		public function your_filter( $bar ) {
			return $bar;
		}

		// Override parent method
		public function parent_method() {
			// Your code!
		}
	}
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'habakiri_child_theme_setup' );

// It is all right outside the class!
function your_filter( $bar ) {
	return $bar;
}
add_filter( 'foo', 'your_filter' );
